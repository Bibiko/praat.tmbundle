Insert picture from file...
</b></font></table></table>
<p>
A command in the <b>World</b> menu of the <a href="Picture_window.html">Picture window</a>.</p>
<h3>
Purpose</h3>
<p>
To draw a picture file (PNG; on Mac and Windows also JPEG or TIFF; other picture formats may also work) into the Picture window (or into the Demo window).</p>
<h3>
Settings</h3>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>File name</b>
<dd>
the name of the picture file. If you use this command in a script, you can use a relative path name such as <code>pictures/myface.png</code> or <code>~/Desktop/hello.png</code>.
<dt>
<b>From x</b>
<dt>
<b>To x</b>
<dd>
The horizontal location (in world coordinates) where the picture will appear. Use the <a href="Axes___.html">Axes...</a> command to set world coordinates if they have not been set implicitly by an earlier <b>Draw</b> or <b>Paint</b> command. If you set <b>From x</b> and <b>To x</b> to the same value, the picture will be horizontally centred around this <i>x</i> value and obtain a width that preserves the aspect ratio (width-to-height ratio) of the original picture.
<dt>
<b>From y</b>
<dt>
<b>To y</b>
<dd>
The vertical location (in world coordinates) where the picture will appear. Use the <a href="Axes___.html">Axes...</a> command to set world coordinates if they have not been set implicitly by an earlier <b>Draw</b> or <b>Paint</b> command. If you set <b>From y</b> and <b>To y</b> to the same value, the picture will be vertically centred around this <i>y</i> value and obtain a height that preserves the aspect ratio (width-to-height ratio) of the original picture.
</dl>
<h3>
Behaviour</h3>
<p>
From the description above, you see that if <b>From x</b> is unequal to <b>To x</b> and <b>From y</b> is unequal to <b>To y</b>, the picture will probably obtain an aspect ratio different from the original picture. To preserve the aspect ratio, either make <b>To x</b> equal to <b>From x</b> or make <b>To y</b> equal to <b>From y</b>.</p>
<p>
To show the picture on the same number of pixels as the original, make <b>To x</b> equal to <b>From x</b> and <b>To y</b> equal to <b>From y</b>. Praat will then show the picture with the original width and height (in pixels), centred around the given <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> values.</p>
<h3>
Usage</h3>
<p>
You will usually use this in a script, and often in a script that runs the <a href="Demo_window.html">Demo window</a>.</p>
