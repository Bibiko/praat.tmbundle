<p>
A command in the File menu of the <a href="Picture_window.html">Picture window</a>, if you are on Windows.</p>
<p>
It saves the selected part of the picture in an "enhanced metafile" (.EMF) format, which can be imported by many Windows programs, like Adobe<sup>&#174;</sup> Illustrator<sup>&#8482;</sup> or Microsoft<sup>&#174;</sup> Word<sup>&#8482;</sup>.</p>
<h3>
Behaviour</h3>
<p>
Though all the picture data will be written to the file, only the part that you selected in the Picture window (the <i>viewport</i>) may become visible in the other program.</p>
<h3>
Usage</h3>
<p>
You will not use this command very often, because it is usually easier to copy the selection to the clipboard with the <a href="Copy_to_clipboard.html">Copy to clipboard</a> command, and `Paste' it into the other program. You may use a metafile instead of the clipboard if the clipboard is too large for the other program to read, or if you want to transfer the picture to another computer.</p>
