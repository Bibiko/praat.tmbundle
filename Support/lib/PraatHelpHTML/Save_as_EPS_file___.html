<p>
A command in the File menu of the <a href="Picture_window.html">Picture window</a>.</p>
<p>
It saves the picture to an <a href="Encapsulated_PostScript.html">Encapsulated PostScript</a> (EPS) file, which can be imported by many other programs, such as Microsoft<sup>&#174;</sup> Word<sup>&#8482;</sup>.</p>
<h3>
Usage</h3>
<p>
EPS files are on the way out, mainly because they do not really support international text. On Macintosh and Linux, it is almost always better to use <a href="Save_as_PDF_file___.html">Save as PDF file...</a> instead, or (on the Mac) to use <a href="Copy_to_clipboard.html">Copy to clipboard</a>. On Windows, which does not really support PDF files yet, you may find that EPS files sometimes creates better quality than <a href="Copy_to_clipboard.html">Copy to clipboard</a>; you should also check out <a href="Save_as_PNG_file___.html">Save as PNG file...</a> on Windows. To import an EPS file in Word, choose <b>Insert</b> &#8594; <b>Picture</b> &#8594; <b>From file...</b>. </p>
<h3>
Behaviour</h3>
<p>
Though all the contents of the Picture window are written to the EPS file, only the part that you selected in the Picture window (the <i>viewport</i>) may become visible in Word (or another program).</p>
<h3>
Settings</h3>
<p>
The EPS picture is saved with the grey resolution and fonts that you specified with <a href="PostScript_settings___.html">PostScript settings...</a>.</p>
