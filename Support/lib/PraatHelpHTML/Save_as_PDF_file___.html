<p>
A command in the File menu of the <a href="Picture_window.html">Picture window</a>, on Macintosh and Linux.</p>
<p>
It saves the picture to a PDF file, which can be imported by several other programs, such as modern versions of Microsoft<sup>&#174;</sup> Word&#8482;.</p>
<h3>
PDF means highest possible quality</h3>
<p>
With PDF pictures you can use high-quality graphics in your word-processor documents. On the Mac, the quality is the same as if you use <a href="Copy_to_clipboard.html">Copy to clipboard</a>.</p>
<p>
On Windows, use <a href="Save_as_PNG_file___.html">Save as PNG file...</a> or <a href="Save_as_EPS_file___.html">Save as EPS file...</a> instead.</p>
<h3>
Behaviour</h3>
<p>
Though all the contents of the Picture window are written to the PDF file, only the part that you selected in the Picture window (the <i>viewport</i>) will become visible in Word (or another program).</p>
<h3>
Usage</h3>
<p>
To import a PDF file in Word, choose <b>Insert</b> &#8594; <b>Picture</b> &#8594; <b>From file...</b>. Word will create a picture with the same size as the originally selected part of the Picture window (the <i>viewport</i>).</p>
