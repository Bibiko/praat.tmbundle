<h3>
1a. Printing on Windows</h3>
<p>
On Windows, the best results will be obtained on PostScript printers, since these have built-in facilities for images (e.g. spectrograms) and rotated text. If a PostScript printer is available, Praat will usually write direct PostScript commands to that printer (see <a href="PostScript_settings___.html">PostScript settings...</a> if you want to switch this off). Praat also supports non-PostScript printers, such as most colour inkjet printers.</p>
<p>
If you don't have a PostScript printer, and you still want PostScript quality, you can save the picture to an EPS file (<a href="Save_as_EPS_file___.html">Save as EPS file...</a>). You can then view this file with the freely available GhostView<sup>&#8482;</sup> program, which you can download from <b>http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/</b>, or convert it to PDF with either GhostView or Adobe<sup>&#174;</sup> Acrobat<sup>&#8482;</sup> Distiller<sup>&#8482;</sup>, which is more reliable than GhostView but is also expensive.</p>
<h3>
1b. Printing on Macintosh</h3>
<p>
On the Mac, Praat will print in PDF, both to PostScript and non-PostScript printers.</p>
<h3>
1c. Printing on Linux</h3>
<p>
On Linux, when you tell Praat to print a picture or manual page, Praat will write the picture to a temporary PostScript file and send this file to a printer with the <i>print command</i>, which you can change with <a href="PostScript_settings___.html">PostScript settings...</a>. You do not need a PostScript printer to print PostScript directly, because the <b>lpr</b> program sends PostScript files through the GhostScript program, which is a part of all modern Linux distributions. The print command is typically <code>lpr %s</code>. By changing the print command (with <a href="PostScript_settings___.html">PostScript settings...</a>), you can change it to something fancier. For instance, if you want to save the woods and print two pages on one sheet of paper, you change it to <code>cat %s | mpage -2 -o -f -m0 | lpr</code>.</p>
<h3>
2. Indirect printing with your word processor</h3>
<p>
If you save your picture to an EPS file, you will be able to include it as a picture in your favourite word processor (Microsoft<sup>&#174;</sup> Word<sup>&#8482;</sup>, LaTeX...). See <a href="Save_as_EPS_file___.html">Save as EPS file...</a>.</p>
<p>
On the Mac it is better to save your picture to a PDF file, which both Microsoft<sup>&#174;</sup> Word<sup>&#8482;</sup> (when using the <b>.docx</b> format) and LaTeX can process. See <a href="Save_as_PDF_file___.html">Save as PDF file...</a>.</p>
<h3>
3. Indirect printing through the clipboard</h3>
<p>
On Windows, pictures included in your word processor via <a href="Copy_to_clipboard.html">Copy to clipboard</a> or <a href="Save_as_Windows_metafile___.html">Save as Windows metafile...</a> will print fine, though not as nicely as EPS files.</p>
<p>
On the Mac, pictures included in your word processor (post-2006 versions) via <a href="Copy_to_clipboard.html">Copy to clipboard</a> will print just as nicely as PDF files (use the <b>.docx</b> format in Microsoft Word).</p>
