<p>
A command available in the <b>Modify</b> menu when you select one or more <a href="Sound.html">Sound</a> objects. With this command you multiply the amplitude of each Sound in such a way that its average (i.e. root-mean-square) intensity becomes the <b>new average intensity</b> that you specify (see Settings).</p>
<h3>

<dl>
<dt>
<b>New average intensity (dB SPL)</b>
<dd>
the new average intensity of the Sound. The standard value is 70 dB SPL. This means that the root-mean-square amplitude of the sound will come to lie 70 dB above the assumed auditory threshold of 0.00002 Pa. Please check whether as a result a peak in the sound does not get below -1 Pa or above +1 Pa. If that happens, the sound will be clipped when played, which will be audible as distortion; in thast case you may want to set this number to 60 dB or even lower.
