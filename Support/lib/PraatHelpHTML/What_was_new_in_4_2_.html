<h3>
Praat 4.2, 4 March 2004</h3>
<p>
General:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
&#8226; July 10, 2003: Open source code (General Public Licence).
</dl>
<p>
Phonetics:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
&#8226; Faster computation of spectrum, spectrogram, and pitch.
<dd>
&#8226; More precision in numeric libraries.
<dd>
&#8226; PitchTier: Interpolate quadratically.
<dd>
&#8226; TextGrids can be saved chronologically (and Praat can read that file again).
<dd>
&#8226; Sound editor window <a href="Time_step_settings___.html">Time step settings...</a>: "Automatic", "Fixed", and "View-dependent".
<dd>
&#8226; Sound window: distinguish basic from advanced spectrogram and pitch settings.
<dd>
&#8226; Read TableOfReal from headerless spreadsheet file...: cells with strings are considered zero.
<dd>
&#8226; Sound window: introduced time step as advanced setting.
<dd>
&#8226; Sound window: reintroduced view range as advanced setting.
<dd>
&#8226; Ltas: Compute trend line, Subtract trend line.
</dl>
<p>
Audio:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
&#8226; Sun workstations: support audio servers.
</dl>
<p>
Graphics:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
&#8226; Better selections in Picture window and editor windows.
<dd>
&#8226; Picture window: better handling of rectangles and ellipses for reversed axes.
<dd>
&#8226; Windows: corrected positioning of pictures on clipboard and in metafiles.
<dd>
&#8226; Windows: EPS files check availability of Times and TimesNewRomanPSMT.
<dd>
&#8226; Polygon: can now also paint in colour instead of only in grey values.
<dd>
&#8226; Unlimited number of points for polygons in PostScript (may not work on very old printers).
<dd>
&#8226; Picture window: line widths on all printers and clipboards are now equal to line widths used on PostScript printers: a line with a line width of "1" will be drawn with a width 3/8 points. This improves the looks of pictures printed on non-PostScript printers, improves the looks of pictures copied to your wordprocessor when printed, and changes the looks of pictures copied to your presentation program.
</dl>
<p>
OT learning:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
&#8226; Metrics grammar supports 'impoverished overt forms', i.e. without secondary stress even if surface structures do have secondary stress.
<dd>
&#8226; Support for crucially tied constraints and tied candidates.
<dd>
&#8226; Support for backtracking in EDCD.
<dd>
&#8226; Queries for testing grammaticality.
</dl>
<p>
Scripting:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
&#8226; ManPages: script links can receive arguments.
<dd>
&#8226; ManPages: variable duration of recording.
<dd>
&#8226; Support for unlimited size of script files in editor window on Windows XP and MacOS X (the Unix editions already had this).
<dd>
&#8226; Improved the reception of <i>sendpraat</i> commands on Windows XP.
