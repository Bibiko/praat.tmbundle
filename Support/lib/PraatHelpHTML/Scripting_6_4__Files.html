Scripting 6.4. Files
</b></font></table></table>
<p>
You can read from and write to text files from a Praat script.</p>
<h3>
Reading a file</h3>
<p>
You can check the availability of a file for reading with the function</p>
<code>
<b>fileReadable</b> (<i>fileName$</i>)<br></code>
<p>
which returns 1 (true) if the file exists and can be read, and 0 (false) otherwise. Note that <i>fileName$</i> is taken relatively to the directory where the script is saved; for instance, if your script is in the directory <b>Paolo/project1</b>, then the file name "hello.wav" refers to <b>Paolo/project1/hello.wav</b>, the file name "yesterday/hello.wav" refers to <b>Paolo/project1/yesterday/hello.wav</b>, and the file name "../project2/hello.wav" refers to <b>Paolo/project2/hello.wav</b> (".." goes one directory up). You can also use full path names such as "C:/Documents and Settings/Paolo/project1/hello.wav" on Windows and "/Users/Paolo/project1/hello.wav" on the Mac.</p>
<p>
To read the contents of an existing text file into a string variable or into a numeric variable, you use</p>
<code>
text$ = readFile$ ("myFile.txt")<br></code>
<p>
or</p>
<code>
number = readFile ("myFile.txt")<br></code>
<p>
If the file does not exist, the script terminates with an error message.</p>
<h3>
Example: reading a settings file</h3>
<p>
Suppose that the file <b>height.inf</b> may contain an appropriate value for a numeric variable called <code>height</code>, which we need to use in our script. We would like to read it with</p>
<code>
height = readFile ("height.inf")<br></code>
<p>
However, this script will fail if the file <b>height.inf</b> does not exist. To guard against this situation, we could check the existence of the file, and supply a default value in case the file does not exist:</p>
<code>
fileName$ = "height.inf"<br></code>
<code>
if fileReadable (fileName$)<br></code>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
height = readFile (fileName$)<br></code>
<code>
else<br></code>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
height = 180<br></code>
<code>
endif<br></code>
<h3>
Writing a file</h3>
<p>
You write into a new text file just as you write into the Info window:</p>
<code>
writeFileLine: "myFile.txt", "The present year is ", 2000 + 13, "."<br></code>
<p>
and likewise you use <i>writeFile</i> if you don't want a newline symbol at the end of the file. If the file cannot be created, the script terminates with an error message.</p>
<p>
To append text at the end of an existing file, you use</p>
<code>
appendFileLine: "myFile.txt", "Next year it will be ", 2000 + 14, "."<br></code>
<p>
With <i>appendFileLine</i> (and <i>appendFile</i>, which does not add the newline), we follow the rule that if the file does not yet exist, it is created first.</p>
<p>
You can create a directory with</p>
<code>
<b>createDirectory</b>: <i>directoryName$</i><br></code>
<p>
where, as with file names, <i>directoryName$</i> can be relative to the directory of the script (e.g. "data", or "yesterday/data", or "../project2/yesterday/data") or an absolute path (e.g. "C:/Documents and Settings/Paolo/project1/yesterday/data" on Windows or "/Users/Paolo/project1/yesterday/data" on the Mac). If the directory already exists, this command does nothing.</p>
<p>
You can delete an existing file with the function</p>
<code>
<b>deleteFile</b>: <i>fileName$</i><br></code>
<p>
If the file does not exist, this command does nothing.</p>
<h3>
Example: writing a table of squares</h3>
<p>
Suppose that we want to create a file with the following text:</p>
<code>
The square of 1 is 1<br></code>
<code>
The square of 2 is 4<br></code>
<code>
The square of 3 is 9<br></code>
<code>
...<br></code>
<code>
The square of 100 is 10000<br></code>
<p>
We can do this by appending 100 lines:</p>
<code>
deleteFile: "squares.txt"<br></code>
<code>
for i to 100<br></code>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
appendFileLine: "squares.txt", "The square of ", i, " is ", i * i<br></code>
<code>
endfor<br></code>
<p>
Note that we delete the file before appending to it, in order that we do not append to an already existing file.</p>
<p>
You can append the contents of the Info window to a file with</p>
<code>
appendFile: "out.txt", info$ ( )<br></code>
<h3>
Directory listings</h3>
<p>
To get the names of the files if a certain type in a certain directory, use <a href="Create_Strings_as_file_list___.html">Create Strings as file list...</a>.</p>
<h3>
Alternative syntax</h3>
<p>
If, on the basis of the syntax of commands and functions in earlier sections you expected that</p>
<code>
text$ = readFile$ ("myFile.txt")<br></code>
<code>
number = readFile ("myFile.txt")<br></code>
<p>
could be written as</p>
<code>
text$ = readFile$: "myFile.txt"<br></code>
<code>
number = readFile: "myFile.txt"<br></code>
<p>
then you are right. The syntax with the colon is equivalent to the syntax with the two parentheses. Conversely, instead of</p>
<code>
<b>deleteFile</b>: <i>fileName$</i><br></code>
<p>
you can also write</p>
<code>
<b>deleteFile</b> (<i>fileName$</i>)<br></code>
