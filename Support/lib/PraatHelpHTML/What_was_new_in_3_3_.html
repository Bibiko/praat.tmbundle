&#8226; Evaluation: For HNR analysis of speech, the cross-correlation method, which has a sensitivity of 60 dB and a typical time resolution of 12 milliseconds, must be considered better than the autocorrelation method, which has a better sensitivity (80 dB), but a much worse time resolution (30 ms). For pitch analysis, the autocorrelation method still beats the cross-correlation method because of its better resistance against noise and echos, and despite its marginally poorer resolution (15 vs. 12 ms).
