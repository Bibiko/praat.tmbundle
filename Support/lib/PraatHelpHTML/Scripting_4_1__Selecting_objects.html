Scripting 4.1. Selecting objects
</b></font></table></table>
<p>
To simulate the mouse-clicked and dragged selection in the list of objects, you have the commands <b>selectObject</b>, <b>plusObject</b> and <b>minusObject</b>.</p>
<p>
Suppose you start Praat and use <b>Create Sound as tone...</b> to create a Sound called <i>tone</i>. In the object list it looks like "1. Sound tone". Suppose you then do <b>To Spectrum...</b> from the <b>Analyse Spectrum</b> menu. A second object, called "2. Spectrum tone" appears in the list and is selected. To select and play the Sound, you can do either</p>
<code>
<b>selectObject</b>: 1<br></code>
<code>
Play<br></code>
<p>
or</p>
<code>
<b>selectObject</b>: "Sound tone"<br></code>
<code>
Play<br></code>
<p>
So you can select an object either by its unique ID (identifier: the unique number by which it appears in the list) or by name.</p>
<p>
The function <b>selectObject</b> works by first deselecting all objects, and then selecting the one you mention. If you don't want to deselect the existing selection, you can use <b>plusObject</b> or <b>minusObject</b>. When the Sound is selected, you can select the Spectrum as well by doing</p>
<code>
<b>plusObject</b>: 2<br></code>
<p>
or</p>
<code>
<b>plusObject</b>: "Spectrum tone"<br></code>
<p>
If you then want to deselect the Sound, and keep the Spectrum selected, you can do</p>
<code>
<b>minusObject</b>: 1<br></code>
<p>
or</p>
<code>
<b>minusObject</b>: "Sound tone"<br></code>
<p>
All these functions can take more than one argument. To select the Sound and the Spectrum together, you can do</p>
<code>
<b>selectObject</b>: 1, 2<br></code>
<p>
or</p>
<code>
<b>selectObject</b>: "Sound tone", "Spectrum tone"<br></code>
<p>
or even</p>
<code>
<b>selectObject</b>: 1, "Spectrum tone"<br></code>
<h3>
How to refer to objects created in your script</h3>
<p>
In a script, you typically don't know whether the IDs of the objects are 1 and 2, or much higher numbers. Fortunately, commands that create a new object give you the ID of the object that is created, so that you can refer to the object later on. For instance, suppose you want to generate a sine wave, play it, draw its spectrum, and then throw away both the Sound and the Spectrum. Here is how you do it:</p>
<code>
sound = Create Sound as pure tone: "sine377",<br></code>
<code>
... 1, 0, 1, 44100, 377, 0.2, 0.01, 0.01   ; remember the ID of the Sound<br></code>
<code>
Play   ; the Sound is selected, so it plays<br></code>
<code>
To Spectrum: "yes"<br></code>
<code>
Draw: 0, 5000, 20, 80, "yes"   ; the Spectrum is selected, so it is drawn<br></code>
<code>
# Remove the created Spectrum and Sound:<br></code>
<code>
<b>plusObject</b>: sound   ; the Spectrum was already selected<br></code>
<code>
Remove<br></code>
<p>
You could also select the objects by name:</p>
<code>
Create Sound as pure tone: "sine377",<br></code>
<code>
... 1, 0, 1, 44100, 377, 0.2, 0.01, 0.01   ; no need to remember the ID of the Sound<br></code>
<code>
Play   ; the Sound is selected, so it plays<br></code>
<code>
To Spectrum: "yes"<br></code>
<code>
Draw: 0, 5000, 20, 80, "yes"   ; the Spectrum is selected, so it is drawn<br></code>
<code>
# Remove the created Spectrum and Sound:<br></code>
<code>
<b>plusObject</b>: "Sound sine377"   ; the Spectrum was already selected<br></code>
<code>
Remove<br></code>
<p>
This works even if there are multiple objects called "Sound sine377", because if there are more objects with the same name, <b>selectObject</b> and <b>plusObject</b> select the most recently created one, i.e., the one nearest to the bottom of the list of objects.</p>
