</dl>
<p>
<b>4.5.24</b> (27 April 2007)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
&#8226; OT learning: added decision strategy MaximumEntropy; this has the same harmony determination method as Harmonic Grammar (include the additive constraint noise), but there is some more variability, in that every candidate gets a relative probability of exp(harmony).
</dl>
<p>
<b>4.5.23</b> (26 April 2007)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
&#8226; Macintosh: much smaller sizes (in kilobytes) of spectrograms for printing and clipboard; this improves the compatibility with other programs such as Microsoft Word for large spectrograms.
</dl>
<p>
<b>4.5.22</b> (25 April 2007)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
&#8226; Macintosh: improved drawing of spectrograms for printing and clipboard (this was crippled in 4.5.18, but now it is better than before 4.5.18).
</dl>
<p>
<b>4.5.21</b> (24 April 2007)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
&#8226; OT learning: corrected HarmonicGrammar (and LinearOT) learning procedure to the stochastic gradient ascent method applied by <a href="Jäger__2003_.html">Jäger (2003)</a> to MaxEnt grammars.

</dl>
<p>
<b>4.5.20</b> (19 April 2007)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
&#8226; Scripting: allow assignments like <code>pitch = To Pitch... 0 75 600</code>.

<dd>
&#8226; More SpectrumTier commands.
<dd>

<b>4.5.16</b> (22 February 2007)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
&#8226; Sound-to-Intensity: made resistant against undefined settings.

</dl>
<p>
<b>4.5.15</b> (12 February 2007)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
&#8226; Windows XP: worked around a bug in Windows XP that could cause Praat to crash when the user moved the mouse pointer over a file in the Desktop in the file selector. The workaround is to temporarily disable file info tips when the file selector window is on the screen.
</dl>
<p>
<b>4.5.14</b> (5 February 2007)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
&#8226; Scripting: some new predefined string variables like preferencesDirectory$.

<p>
<b>4.5.13</b> (3 February 2007)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
&#8226; For stereo sounds, pitch analysis is based on correlations pooled over channels (rather than on correlations of the channel average).
<dd>
&#8226; For stereo sounds, spectrogram analysis is based on power density averaged across channels (rather than on the power density of the channel average).
<dd>
&#8226; Scripting: removed a bug introduced in 4.5.06 that caused some variables not to be substituted.
</dl>
<p>

<b>4.5.11</b> (29 January 2007)</p>

<p>
<b>4.5.05</b> (5 December 2006)</p>
<dl>
<dd>
&#8226; Macintosh scripting: European symbols such as &#246; and &#233; and &#231; are now allowed in file names in scripts and in MacRoman-encoded file names sent by other programs through the sendpraat subroutine.
</dl>
<p>
<b>4.5.04</b> (1 December 2006)</p>
