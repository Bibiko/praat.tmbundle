Scripting 1. Your first scripts
</b></font></table></table>
<p>
This page tells you how to create, run and save a script. To get a feel for how it works, you are advised to try out all the steps.</p>
<h3>
1. A minimal script</h3>
<p>
Suppose that you want to create a script that allows you to play a selected Sound object twice. You first create an empty script, by choosing <a href="New_Praat_script.html">New Praat script</a> from the <b>Praat</b> menu in the <b>Praat Objects</b> window. A <a href="ScriptEditor.html">ScriptEditor</a> window will appear on your screen:</p>
<p align=middle><img height=400 width=600 src=Scripting_1__Your_first_scripts_1.png></p><p>
In this window, you type</p>
<code>
Play<br></code>
<code>
Play<br></code>
<p>
Now select a Sound in the <b>Praat Objects</b> window. As you expect from selecting a Sound, a <b>Play</b> button will appear in the dynamic menu. If you now choose <b>Run</b> from the <b>Run</b> menu in the ScriptEditor, Praat will play the sound twice. This works because <b>Play</b> is a command that becomes available in the dynamic menu when you select a Sound.</p>
<h3>
2. Some more commands</h3>
<p>
In the above example, you could use the <b>Play</b> command because that was the text on a button currently available in the dynamic menu. Apart from these selection-dependent (dynamic) commands, you can also use all fixed commands from the menus of the <a href="Object_window.html">Object window</a> and the <a href="Picture_window.html">Picture window</a>. For instance, try the following script:</p>
<code>
Erase all<br></code>
<code>
Draw inner box<br></code>
<code>
Play<br></code>
<code>
Play<br></code>
<code>
Erase all<br></code>
<p>
When you run this script, you'll see a rectangle appear in the <b>Praat Picture</b> window (that's what the command <b>Draw inner box</b> in the <b>Margins</b> menu does), then you'll hear the Sound play tiwce, then you'll see the rectangle disappear from the Picture window (that's what the command <b>Erase all</b> from the <b>Edit</b> menu does).</p>
<p>
Here we see that the Praat scripting language is an example of a <i>procedural programming language</i>, which means that the five <i>statements</i> are executed in the order in which they appear in the script, i.e. first <b>Erase all</b>, then <b>Draw inner box</b>, then <b>Play</b> twice, and finally <b>Erase all</b>.</p>
<h3>
3. Experimenting with your script</h3>
<p>
You don't have to be afraid of making mistakes. Here are a couple that you can try to make.</p>
<p>
First, try to run the script when a Sound is not selected (e.g. you create a Pitch object from it and keep that selected, or you throw away the Sound). You will notice that Praat gives you an error message saying <b>The command "Play" is not available for the current selection</b>. Indeed, if you select a Pitch or if you select nothing, then no command <b>Play</b> appears in the dynamic menu, so the script cannot execute it. Note that the commands <b>Erase all</b> and <b>Draw inner box</b> are still available, because they continue to be present in the menus of the Picture window; therefore, the script will execute the first two lines (<code>Erase all </code>and<code> Draw inner box</code>) and stop running at the third line, i.e. at your first<code> Play</code>. The result is that the "box" will stay visible in the Picture window, because the fifth line of the script, which should erase the box, is never executed.</p>
<p>
Second, try to mistype a command (there's a good chance you already did it by accident), e.g. write<code> PLay </code>instead of<code> Play</code>, or<code> Draw inner bocks </code>or whatever. Again, you are likely to get a message saying that that command is not available. Such messages are the most common messages that you'll see when writing scripts; now you know that they mean either that you mistyped something or that you made the wrong selection.</p>
<h3>
4. Saving your script</h3>
<p>
The <b>File</b> menu of the ScriptEditor has a command <b>Save</b>, with which you can save your script as a file on disk, for instance under the name<code> test.praat</code>.</p>
<p>
Please try this with the five-line script you just typed. After saving the script, the name of the script file will appear in the window title:</p>
<p align=middle><img height=400 width=600 src=Scripting_1__Your_first_scripts_2.png></p><p>
After you save your script, you can close the ScriptEditor window without losing the script: you can reopen the script file by using <a href="Open_Praat_script___.html">Open Praat script...</a> from the <b>Praat</b> menu, or by choosing <b>New Praat script</b> again, followed by <b>Open...</b> from the ScriptEditor's <b>File</b> menu.</p>
<p>
It advisable to use<code> .praat </code>as the extension for script file names. On the Mac, if you double-click a<code> .praat </code>file, Praat will automatically start up and show the script. On the Mac and on Windows, if you drag a<code> .praat </code>file on the Praat icon, Praat will also start up and show the script.</p>
