<p>
A command in the File menu of the <a href="Picture_window.html">Picture window</a>, on all platforms.</p>
<p>
It saves the picture to a PNG ("ping") image file, which can be imported by several other programs, such as Microsoft<sup>&#174;</sup> Word&#8482;. For the resolution you can choose between 600 dots per inch (very good quality even when printed) and 300 dpi (enough for all web sites, even on retina displays).</p>
<h3>
Usage in text processors</h3>
<p>
On Windows, PNG files may sometimes have the best quality that you can get, although you should also try <a href="Save_as_EPS_file___.html">Save as EPS file...</a> and <a href="Copy_to_clipboard.html">Copy to clipboard</a>. On Macintosh or Linux, <a href="Save_as_PDF_file___.html">Save as PDF file...</a> or <a href="Copy_to_clipboard.html">Copy to clipboard</a> is almost always better.</p>
<h3>
Usage for publication</h3>
<p>
Some publishers do not accept PDF pictures. In such a case, they may accept 600-dpi or 300-dpi PNG pictures. If they accept TIFF pictures only, then you can easily convert your PNG picture to a TIFF picture with any graphics converter program.</p>
<h3>
Behaviour</h3>
<p>
Only the contents of the part of the Picture window that you selected (the <i>viewport</i>) are written to the PNG file.</p>
<h3>
Usage</h3>
<p>
To import a PNG file in Word, choose <b>Insert</b> &#8594; <b>Picture</b> &#8594; <b>From file...</b>. Word will create a picture with the same size as the originally selected part of the Picture window (the <i>viewport</i>).</p>
