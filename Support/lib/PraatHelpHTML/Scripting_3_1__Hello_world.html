Scripting 3.1. Hello world
</b></font></table></table>
<p>
Many manuals of computer programming languages start with their answer on the following question:</p>
<p>
<i>How do I write the text "Hello world" on the screen?</i></p>
<p>
For the Praat scripting language, there are two answers.</p>
<h3>
1. "Hello world" in the Info window</h3>
<p>
The simplest answer is that you open the ScriptEditor window with <b>New Praat script</b> from the <b>Praat</b> menu, then type the following line into the ScriptEditor window:</p>
<code>
writeInfoLine: "Hello world"<br></code>
<p>
and finally choose <b>Run</b> from the <b>Run</b> menu.</p>
<p>
When you try this, the result should be that the Info window comes to the front, and that it shows the text <code>Hello world</code>:</p>
<p align=middle><img height=300 width=600 src=Scripting_3_1__Hello_world_1.png></p><p>
Now suppose that you to write two lines instead of just one, so you try a script with two lines:</p>
<code>
writeInfoLine: "Hello world"<br></code>
<code>
writeInfoLine: "How do you do?"<br></code>
<p>
This turns out not to do what you want: it seems to write only the text <code>How do you do?</code>. This happens because the <b>writeInfoLine</b> function first erases the Info window, then writes the line of text. So the first line of the script did write the text <code>Hello world</code>, but the second line wiped it out and wrote <code>How do you do?</code> instead. The script that does what you want is</p>
<code>
writeInfoLine: "Hello world"<br></code>
<code>
appendInfoLine: "How do you do?"<br></code>
<p>
Now the result will be</p>
<p align=middle><img height=300 width=600 src=Scripting_3_1__Hello_world_2.png></p><p>
This works because <b>appendInfoLine</b> writes a line without erasing the Info window first.</p>
<p>
Finally, try the following script:</p>
<code>
appendInfoLine: "Another try"<br></code>
<code>
appendInfoLine: "Goodbye"<br></code>
<p>
The result could be</p>
<p align=middle><img height=300 width=600 src=Scripting_3_1__Hello_world_3.png></p><p>
In other words, <b>appendInfoLine</b> writes lines into the Info window without erasing it, even if you run a script anew. This is why many Praat scripts that write into the Info window do a <b>writeInfoLine</b> first, and follow it with a series of <b>appendInfoLine</b> calls.</p>

<h3>
2. "Hello world" in the Picture window.</h3>
<p>
You can also show text in the Picture window. If you are an experienced Praat user, you have probably used the comamnd <b>Text top...</b> before. You can use it do draw a text at the top of the current <i>viewport</i>, which is the part of the Picture window where the next drawing will occur and which is marked by the pink <i>margins</i>. Thus, when you select the top 4&#215;3 inches of the Picture window (with the mouse), set the font size to 12 (with the <b>Pen</b> menu), and run the script</p>
<code>
Text top: "yes", "Hello world"<br></code>
<p>
then you'll see</p>
<p align=middle><img height=450 width=600 src=Scripting_3_1__Hello_world_4.png></p><p>
So this works the same as when you choose <b>Text top...</b> from the <b>Margins</b> menu by hand, with <b>Far</b> switched on.</p>
<p>
If you want your script to always show the same text at the same position, with nothing else in the picture, then you can make your script a bit more extensive:</p>
<code>
Erase all<br></code>
<code>
Times<br></code>
<code>
Font size: 12<br></code>
<code>
Select outer viewport: 0, 4, 0, 3<br></code>
<code>
Text top: "yes", "Hello world"<br></code>
<p>
In this script, line 1 erases the Picture window, so that nothing besides your text can appear in the Picture window.</p>
<p>
Line 2 executes the command <b>Times</b> from the <b>Font</b> menu, so that the script will always draw the text in Times, even if you choose <b>Helvetica</b> in the <b>Font</b> menu with the mouse before you run the script (after the script has run, you'll see that <b>Times</b> is chosen in the <b>Font</b> menu).</p>
<p>
Line 3 executes the command <b>Font size...</b> from the <b>Font</b> menu, setting the font size to 12 and setting the width of the pink margins accordingly.</p>
<p>
Line 4 executes the command <a href="Select_outer_viewport___.html">Select outer viewport...</a> from the <b>Select</b> menu. This performs an action that you would normally do by dragging the mouse, namely selecting the part of the Picture window that runs from 0 to 4 inches horizontally and from 0 to 3 inches vertically. After running the script, the <i>viewport</i> is indeed [0, 4] &#215; [0, 3], as you can clearly see from the pink margins above.</p>
<p>
Line 5 finally writes the text.</p>
