Sound files 3. Files that Praat can read
</b></font></table></table>
<p>
Praat can read five types of standard sound files in several formats, and a number of proprietary types of sound files as well.</p>
<h3>
Standard sound files</h3>
<p>
The <a href="Open_menu.html">Open menu</a> contains two commands for opening sound files:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
&#8226; With <a href="Read_from_file___.html">Read from file...</a>, you read the entire file into memory. A <a href="Sound.html">Sound</a> object will appear in the list. This is appropriate if your sound is not too long to fit into memory. The advantage of having a <a href="Sound.html">Sound</a> object is that you can perform analysis on it directly.
<dd>
&#8226; With <a href="Open_long_sound_file___.html">Open long sound file...</a>, you open a sound file that is too long to read into memory completely. A <a href="LongSound.html">LongSound</a> object will appear in the list. You will typically choose <b>View</b> to view the contents of this sound and analyse it. Praat will only read so much of the file into memory as is needed to play or display parts of it.
</dl>
<p>
Both commands understand the following five standard audio file formats:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
&#8226; WAV:
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&#8226; 8-bit A-law
<dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&#8226; linear 8-bit unsigned
<dd>
&#8226; AIFF or AIFC:
