<dt>
<b>Minimum F1 (Hz)</b>
<dd>
suppresses models whose average first formant frequency, <i>f1</i>, is below <i>minimumF1</i> by a factor sqrt (<i>minimumF1</i> - <i>f1</i> + 1). You can use this constraint to disfavour models with a low average first formant. Sometimes due to the generally high frequency of the /a/ a lower harmonic of the fundamental frequency is taken as a candidate for the first formant. You can suppress these models with this constraint.
<dt>
<b>Maximum F1 (Hz)</b>
<dd>
suppresses models whose average first formant frequency, <i>f1</i>, is above <i>maximumF1</i> by a factor sqrt (<i>f1</i> - <i>maximumF1</i> + 1).You can use this constraint to disfavour models in which the first formant is missing. 
<dt>
<b>Minimum F2 (Hz)</b>
<dd>
suppresses models whose average second formant frequency, <i>f2</i>, is below <i>minimumF2</i> by a factor sqrt (<i>minimumF2</i> - <i>f2</i> + 1). This constraint might be used for high front vowels that normally have a large distance between the first and second formant. 
<dt>
<b>Maximum F2 (Hz)</b>
<dd>
suppresses models whose average second formant frequency, <i>f2</i>, is above <i>maximumF2</i> by a factor sqrt (<i>f2</i> - <i>maximumF2</i> + 1). This factor is sometimes necessary to suppress models for high back vowels where the second formant is "missing", i.e. where the third formant is playing the role of the second. 
<dt>
<b>Minimum F3 (Hz)</b>
<dd>
suppress models whose average third formant frequency, <i>f3</i>, is below <i>minimumF3</i> by a factor sqrt (<i>minimumF3</i> - <i>f3</i> + 1). This constraint might sometimes be usefull to suppress low lying third formants that can occur for /a/-like vowels.
