<h3>
Praat 4.3, 26 January 2005</h3>
<p>
General:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
&#8226; `Apply' button in settings windows for menu commands and in script forms.
<dd>
&#8226; Info window can be saved.
<dd>
&#8226; Removed 30,000-character limit in Info window.
</dl>
<p>
Phonetics:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
&#8226; Speeded up intensity analysis by a factor of 10 (by making its time resolution 0.01 ms rather than 0.0001 ms at a sampling frequency of 44 kHz).
<dd>
&#8226; Speeded up pitch analysis and spectrogram analysis by a factor of two.
<dd>
&#8226; Sound: To Spectrum... now has a reasonably fast non-FFT version.
<dd>
&#8226; Calibrated long-term average spectrum (Sound: To Ltas...).
<dd>
&#8226; Pitch-corrected LTAS analysis.
<dd>
&#8226; Sound: Scale intensity.
<dd>
&#8226; PitchTier: To Sound (sine).
<dd>
&#8226; Better warnings against use of the LPC object.
</dl>
<p>
Voice:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
&#8226; July 9, 2004 (4.2.08): Shimmer measurements: more accurate and less sensitive to additive noise.
<dd>
&#8226; More extensive voice report: pitch statistics; harmonicity.
</dl>
<p>
Audio:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
&#8226; Reading and opening 24-bit and 32-bit sound files (saving still goes in 16 bits).
<dd>
&#8226; LongSound: save separate channels.
<dd>
&#8226; Macintosh: much faster reading of WAV files.
</dl>
<p>
Listening experiments:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
&#8226; Subjects can now respond with keyboard presses.
</dl>
<p>
Graphics:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
&#8226; One can now drag the inner viewport in the Picture window, excluding the margins. This is nice e.g. for creating square viewports or for drawing a waveform and a spectrogram in close contact.
<dd>
&#8226; Unix: picture highlighting as on Mac and Windows.
<dd>
&#8226; More drawing methods for Sound and Ltas (curve, bars, poles, speckles).
</dl>
<p>
OT learning:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
&#8226; Monitor rankings when learning.
<dd>
&#8226; OTGrammar: Remove harmonically bounded candidates...
<dd>
&#8226; OTGrammar: Save as headerless spreadsheet file...
<dd>
&#8226; Metrics grammar: added *Clash, *Lapse, WeightByPosition and *MoraicConsonant.
</dl>
<p>
Scripting:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
&#8226; nowarn, noprogress, nocheck.
<dd>
&#8226; Line numbers.
</dl>
